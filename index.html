            Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
      
            It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.
            Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
            Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
            Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. The following are classes of python objects:
      
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>object method</li>
            <li>The pass Statement</li>
            <li>Delete Object Properties</li>
            <li>Modify Object Properties</li>
            <li>Object Methods</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Comment">
          <header>Comment</header>
          <p>A comment is a piece of text within a program that is not executed. It can be used to provide additional information to aid in understanding the code.
            The # character is used to start a comment and it continues until the end of the line.
            <code> # comment on a single line
              user = "Ahmad" # comment after the code </code>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="print()_Function">
          <header>print() Function</header>
          <p>The print() function is used to output text, numbers, or other printable information to the
            console.
            It takes one or more arguments and will output each of the arguments to the console
            separated by a space. If no arguments are provided, the print() function will output a
            blank line. for example: ptint("Hello World!") will result to Hello World. Or pi = 3.142, print(pi) will result to 3.142</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
          <header>Strings</header>
          <p>A string is a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, whitespace or punctuation)
            enclosed by quotation marks. It can be enclosed using either the double quotation mark "
            or the single quotation mark ' .
            If a string has to be broken into multiple lines, the backslash character \ can be used to
            indicate that the string continues on the next line. For example:<code> a = "Hello, World!"
              print(a).</code> the quotation in Hello World make it a strings words</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="String_Concatenation">
          <header>String Concatenation</header>
          <p>Python supports the joining (concatenation) of strings together using the + operator. The
            + operator is also used for mathematical addition operations. If the parameters passed to
            the + operator are strings, then concatenation will be performed. If the parameter passed
            to + have different types, then Python will report an error condition. Multiple variables or
            literal strings can be joined together using the + operator. The concatenation process
            does not add any whitespace between the strings that are joined. for eample:a = "Hello"
            b = "World"
            c = a + b
            print(c)</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variable">
          <header>Variable</header>
          <p>A variable is used to store data that will be used by the program. This data can be a
            number, a string, a Boolean, a list or some other data type. Every variable has a name
            which can consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore character _ .
            The equal sign = is used to assign a value to a variable. After the initial assignment is
            made, the value of a variable can be updated to new values as needed. #Legal variable names:
            myvar = "John"
            my_var = "John"
            _my_var = "John"
            myVar = "John"

          <header>SyntaxError</header>
          <p>A SyntaxError is reported by the Python interpreter when some portion of the code is
            incorrect. This can include misspelled keywords, missing or too many brackets or
            parenthesis, incorrect operators, missing or too many quotation marks, or other conditions.# theofficefacts.py

        <section class="main-section" id="NameError">
          <header>NameError</header>
          <p>A NameError is reported by the Python interpreter when it detects a variable that is
            unknown. This can occur when a variable is used before it has been assigned a value or if
            a variable name is spelled differently than the point at which it was defined. The Python
            interpreter will display the line of code where the NameError was detected and indicate
            which name it found that was not defined.def log_invalid_object(value):

          <header>Integers</header>
          <p>An integer is a number that can be written without a fractional part (no decimal). An
            integer can be a positive number, a negative number or the number 0 so long as there is
            no decimal portion.
            The number 0 represents an integer value but the same number written as 0.0 would
            represent a floating point number. Example,<code> table = 4, chair = 5 <code></p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Floating_Point_Number">
          <header>Floating Point Number</header>
          <p>Python variables can be assigned different types of data. One supported data type is the floating point number. A floating point number is a value that contains a decimal portion. It
            can be used to represent numbers that have fractional quantities. For example, a = 3/5
            can not be represented as an integer, so the variable a is assigned a floating point value
            of 0.6 . example:<code> pi = 3.142 </code></p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Arithemetic_Operation">
          <header>Arithemetic Operation</header>
          <p>Python supports different types of arithmetic operations that can be performed on literal
            numbers, variables, or some combination. The primary arithmetic operators are:
            <code> Modulo Operator %
              # Floating ppooiinntt numbers
              pi == 33..1144115599
              meal__cost == 1122..9999
              tip__percent == 00..2200
              ● + for addition
              ● - for subtraction
              ● * for multiplication
              ● / for division
              ● % for modulus (returns the remainder)
              ● ** for exponentiation </code></p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Modulo_Operator">
          <header>Modulo Operator</header>
          <p>A modulo calculation returns the remainder of a division between the first and second
            number. For example:
            String Concatenation
            Python supports the joining (concatenation) of strings together using the + operator. The
            + operator is also used for mathematical addition operations. If the parameters passed to
            the + operator are strings, then concatenation will be performed. If the parameter passed
            to + have different types, then Python will report an error condition. Multiple variables or
            literal strings can be joined together using the + operator. The concatenation process
            does not add any whitespace between the strings that are joined.
            Plus-Equals Operator +=
            The result of the expression 4 % 2 would result in the value 0, because 4 is evenly
            divisible by 2 leaving no remainder.
             
            The result of the expression 7 % 3 would return 1, because 7 is not evenly divisible by
            3, leaving a remainder of 1.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Plus_Equals_Operator">
          <header>Plus Equals Operator</header>
          <p>The plus-equals operator += provides a convenient way to add a value to an existing
            variable and assign the new value back to the same variable. In the case where the
            variable and the value are strings, this operator performs string concatenation instead of
            addition.
            The operation is performed in-place, meaning that any other variable which points to the
            variable being updated will also be updated. >>> class Adder(object):
            <code>def __init__(self, num=0):
              self.num = num
      
              def __iadd__(self, other):
              print 'in __iadd__', other
              self.num = self.num + other
              return self.num
      
              >>> a = Adder(2)
              >>> a += 3
